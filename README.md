# Space Sim
A gravity / planet simulator (though it is not a very accurate implementation of gravity).

## Running
```
odin run .
```

There are 5 different simulations available by pressing A, B, C, or D, E on the keyboard.
The primary mode in the future will likely be mode E, which should eventually be a mode where you can place, customize, and have great control over the overall environment.
Eventually the other 4 modes will probably be implemented into the mode E.
